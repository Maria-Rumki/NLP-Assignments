## Resume Parser

We used Flask to create a web-based resume parser that can parse education and skills from a uploaded resume. For this application, one has to upload a resume in the website and then he can extract the necessary information (i.e, education and skills) from that resume.

For this task, we used spacy to extract the education and skills from the document. Then we created the necassary frontend using html and css to display the process in a web application. We used "requirements.txt" file which contains all the necessary libraries, created "app.py" to apply Flask and pass the necessary function in the application.

A few screenshots from the web application are attached below:
